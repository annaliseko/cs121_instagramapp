# cs121_instagramapp
# Overview
This is a project for HMC's Fall 2017 CS121 class. It was created by following the video tutorial ["Make an instagram like site in under 30 minutes! (Ruby on Rails)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE). This project is a simplified Ruby on Rails version of Instagram. It allows a user to register an account, log in with the account they just made and add photos that will appear on the main page, with your most recent post first (via [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8109407/switch-order-of-blog-posts)). When the user adds a photo they are also allowed to add a caption that will go with the photo they upload.
<br><br>
Additional features include "forgot password", "edit post", and "delete post". The latter two features are not from the video, but from [a separate tutorial on devwalks](https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-in-rails-part-1/).
<br><br>
Another thing that is different from the video tutorial is that the background color was changed to a light blue, and each photo has a purple dotted border (via [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp)).<br>
Like instagram, users can then scroll down the main page to see all the images that have been uploaded. Enjoy! :)<br>

When someone uses this site for the first time they will see this page. They have to first register for an account or log in before being able to upload any photos.

This is the page that would show up when you wanted to register an account. If you already have an account, click "log in", and you will then see the log in page. If you forgot your password you can click "Forgot Your Password?" and it will redirect you to the "forgot password" page.

Once you're logged in, you can then add a new post by selecting "New Post" in the menu bar. This will bring you to this page where you can select an image and type in a fun caption.

Once you've uploaded your photo it will appear on the main page where all your uploaded images will be. You can get to the main page by clicking on "annaliseko's Instagram" in the menu bar. When you're on the main page, your most recent post will appear first.

When you click on an image it will bring you to the individual post page. On this page you can edit the post by clicking on the "edit post" button.

The "edit post" button will bring you to the edit post page where you can change the image, edit the caption, or delete the post entirely.

When you click on "delete post" you will be prompted with a message asking if you are sure you want to delete the post. When you click "confirm" the photo will be deleted and a flash message will say that your photo has been successfully deleted.
